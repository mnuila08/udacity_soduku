# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: Constraint Propogation involves using local constraints in space to dramatically reduce the search space. We utilize the naked twins as a strategy to reduce our search space by first finding any box within the dictionary that has values equal than two, and finds a peer that has also the same values equal to two. And uses these twins to remove those values from peers containing those values. This dramatically will reduce our search space.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: Diagonal Sudoku can be solved adding an additional unit to sudoku, the diagonal. So that each diagonal entry has diagonal entries as their peers. That way we solve using this new constraint. Each box along the diagonal now belongs to another unit and now has peers. The strategies in this case are elimination, only choice, and naked tiwns. We continue the elimination process of enforcing a constraint to search space until we find a solution.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solutions.py` - You'll fill this in as part of your solution.
* `solution_test.py` - Do not modify this. You can test your solution by running `python solution_test.py`.
* `PySudoku.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the ```assign_values``` function provided in solution.py

### Data

The data consists of a text file of diagonal sudokus for you to solve.
